The BAltic Gene Set (BAGS.v1) gene catalogue encompasses 67,566,251 genes.
The 67 million genes are based on metagenomic data from Alneberg at al. (2020) from 124 seawater samples that span the 
salinity and oxygen gradients of the Baltic Sea and capture seasonal dynamics at two locations.
To obtain the gene catalogue, we used a mix-assembly approach described in Delgado et al. (2021).
The gene catalogue has been functionally and taxonomically annotated, as described in Delgado et al. (2021).
Here you find gene and protein sequences, and different types of annotations for the proteins. Also, contigs for the 
co-assembly are included (see the Delgado paper).
